# AWS Operations Environment

This directory contains configurations for deploying a security operations and management cluster on AWS EKS.

## Overview

The operations environment is designed for:
- Security monitoring and incident response
- Infrastructure management and automation
- Compliance and audit logging
- Backup and disaster recovery operations

## Key Configurations

### Compute
- **Instance Types**: m5.xlarge for consistent performance
- **Dedicated Hosts**: For compliance requirements
- **Node Groups**: Separate groups for different security zones

### Storage
- **EBS**: io2 storage for high-performance logging
- **S3**: Centralized log storage with lifecycle policies
- **Glacier**: Long-term audit log retention

### Networking
- **Private Endpoints**: All AWS service access via PrivateLink
- **VPN/Direct Connect**: Secure connectivity to on-premises
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolated subnets for different functions

### Security & Compliance
- **AWS Security Hub**: Centralized security findings
- **GuardDuty**: Threat detection enabled
- **CloudTrail**: Multi-region logging
- **Config**: Compliance rule monitoring
- **KMS**: Customer-managed keys for encryption

### Monitoring & Logging
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Centralized log aggregation
- **X-Ray**: Distributed tracing
- **Amazon Managed Prometheus**: Long-term metrics storage
- **Amazon Managed Grafana**: Unified dashboards

## Key Components

### Security Tools
- Kubescape for Kubernetes security scanning
- Kyverno for policy enforcement
- Falco for runtime security
- Trivy for vulnerability scanning

### Operations Tools
- ArgoCD for GitOps deployments
- Crossplane for infrastructure management
- Velero for backup/restore operations
- Prometheus for metrics collection

## Access Control

- SAML/OIDC integration with AWS SSO
- Break-glass procedures documented
- Privileged access management
- Audit trail for all operations

## Deployment

```bash
# Apply operations configurations
kubectl apply -k .

# Verify security components
kubectl get pods -n security-tools
kubectl get pods -n operations
```
