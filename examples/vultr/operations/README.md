This directory contains configurations for deploying a security operations and management cluster on Vultr.

## Overview

The operations environment is designed for:
- Security monitoring and compliance
- Infrastructure management
- Centralized logging and monitoring
- Backup and recovery operations

## Key Configurations

### Compute

- **Bare Metal**: Optional for compliance
- **Node Count**: 3 nodes minimum
- **Location**: Primary datacenter only
- **Isolated**: Dedicated instances

### Storage
- **NVMe Storage**: For logs and metrics
- **Block Storage**: Encrypted volumes
- **Object Storage**: Immutable backups
- **Snapshot**: Automated hourly

### Networking
- **Private Network**: Fully isolated
- **No Public IPs**: On cluster nodes
- **VPN Access**: Site-to-site only
- **Firewall**: Whitelist only
- **Reserved IPs**: For VPN endpoints

### Security Features
- **DDoS Protection**: Maximum level
- **Firewall Groups**: Strict rules
- **Network Isolation**: Private VPC

## Access Control

- VPN-only access
- Hardware token MFA
- Time-limited sessions
- Audit all actions
- Quarterly access review

## Deployment

```bash
# Connect to VPN first
# Configure kubectl
export KUBECONFIG=./vke-operations-kubeconfig.yaml

# Apply operations configurations
kubectl apply -k .

# Verify security components
kubectl get pods -n security-tools
kubectl get pods -n operations
```
